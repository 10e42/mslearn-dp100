# MSLEARN-DP100

This repository contains the hands-on lab exercises for Microsoft course [DP-100 *Designing and Implementing a Data Science Solution on Azure*](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/certifications/courses/dp-100t01) and the equivalent [self-paced modules on Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/build-ai-solutions-with-azure-ml-service/). The labs are designed to accompany the learning materials and enable you to practice using the technologies described them.

The labs require a Microsoft Azure subscription. If your instructor has not provided you with one, you can sign up for a free trial at [https://azure.microsoft.com](https://azure.microsoft.com).
